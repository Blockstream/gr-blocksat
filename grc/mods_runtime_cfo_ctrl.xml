  <doc>Runtime Carrier Frequency Offset Control

Observes carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimations and makes sure that the \
the CFO is always within a correctable range. A CFO threshold is configured to this \
block and relates to the maximum CFO that can be estimated and, consequently, \
corrected in software. Once the CFO estimation at the input exceeds the threshold, \
the block changes the RF center frequency that should be used to alter the frequency \
in hardware (e.g. in the USRP/RTL) instead.

The reason why this block is used is because CFO estimation algorithms are only able \
to estimate CFOs within a certain range. In order to keep the CFO always within this \
range, one solution is to update the RF center frequency every time it exceeds the  \
range. Once the center frequency itself is changed, the CFO with respect to the new \
center frequency (and not to the nominal center freq.) is close to 0, so that the \
CFO estimation algorithm will continue to be able to estimate the forthcoming CFOs \
properly. Note that this is useful when the CFO changes significantly over time, for \
example in the case when low-stability LNBs are used for satellite reception.

This block also combines well with a CFO estimation algorithm that relies on \
averaging when outputing CFO estimations. The *avg_len* parameter of this \
block is used to ensure that the output CFO estimation (the post-processed \
one) is non-zero only after the averaging transitory has passed.

Parameters:
avg_len           -> Transitory length of the CFO estimation averaging
abs_cfo_threshold -> Threshold for the absolute value of the CFO
rf_center_freq    -> Nominal (or starting) RF center frequency
